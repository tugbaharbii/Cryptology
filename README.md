# Cryptology

In this project, thanks to socket programming, it is ensured that while two clients communicate with each other via the server, the third client cannot be aware of this. 
In the project, first of all, public and private keys are created with the RSA algorithm, and the public keys are kept on the server and the private keys are sent to the clients.
When clients want to message each other, a common key is generated on the server to communicate with the AES algorithm, and this key is encrypted by the clients' own public keys and sent to them. AES key encryption is done so that another client cannot listen to the communication between two clients. Clients who receive the encrypted key decrypt the key with their own private keys and use it to encrypt the message. After encrypting the message, they extract the message with the HASH functions, sign it with the private key, and send it to the other client with their own public key. The other party decrypts the message with the AES key and extracts the summary of the message with the HASH function. It compares the signature with the other party's public key and confirms the accuracy of the message.
